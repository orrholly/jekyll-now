So, I finally wrapped up the series about the PostgreSQL extension: [set_user](https://github.com/pgaudit/set_user).

I learned a lot and have to say that [Crunchy Data](https://www.crunchydata.com/) created a nifty component to help secure your PostgreSQL databases from hackers and predators. Basically advanced auditing for escalating users to superuser status (thus the Superman theme).

Here are links to posts that comprise the series:
