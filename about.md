####I love the challenge and constant learning curve of technology.

I have spent the past 20+ years working in technology on the east and west coasts. My journey has taken me to  jobs as desktop and web developer, database administrator, data steward, analyst, helpdesk, educator, and product manager. 

I have an MS in Information and Knowledge Strategy from Columbia University and a BA in Political Science with a minor in Geography from Temple University. I have taught graduate level GIS courses at NYU and Hunter College.

In a past life, I toured in a rock band playing lead electric guitar. Today, when I’m not attending my son’s break dancing recitals, I play for fun in my rock band, [Giant Gowanus](http://giantgowan.us/).
